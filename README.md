# Grid

## **Creating grid**
```css
	display:grid;
```
By giving display: grid wonâ€™t make any change but it stands for initialisation. <br/>

## **Create rows and column**
```css
	grid-template-rows:150px 150px;
 	grid-template-columns: 150px 150px 150px;
```
Here for rows two 150px stands for each rows. For example if we give 150px three time then it would be three rows.<br />
Same for column as well.<br />
Instead of px we can give fr which stands for fractional unit specially used for grid measurements.<br /> 
It is mainly used to fill the grid along with the width of container.
```css 
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr; 
```
Instead of giving 1fr for 3 times we can also give 
```css 
grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr) 
```
<br />

## **Create gaps**
```css
            grid-row-gap:30px;
            grid-column-gap:30px;
            grid-gap:30px 50px;
```
Either 1&2 or 3.
```css 
Grid-gap: width height; 
```
can also give 
```css 
grid-gap: 30px 
``` 
if both width and height has same value.<br />
<br />

## **Positioning Grid items**
For example we have 6 items under a container with 2 rows and 3 columns.<br />
To position 1st item of grid to the 3rd column and 2nd row.<br />
```css
.item1{
            background-color:orangered;
            grid-column: 2/3;
            grid-row:1/2 }
```
Here grid-column: 2/3 means place me at 2nd column where 3 is the ending column and 2 is the staring column<br />
Same to row.<br />

## **Grid Span**<br />
```css
.item1 {
  grid-column: 1 / span 2;
}
```
This is most important topic. It spans the cells.<br />
For example 1/ span 2 means. Place me at the 1st cell and make my width elastic with 2nd row <br />
To extend till end of 1st row we can give grid-column 1/-1<br />

## **Naming grid areas**<br />
Why we need to name the grid area?<br />
Because it simplifies the content. For example instead of giving 1/ span2  we can stretch the area by just giving name.<br />
Inside container   <br />

```css
grid-template-areas: "header header header header"
                                "sidebar main main main"
                                "sidebar main main main"
                                "sidebar box1 box2 box3"
                                "footer footer footer footer";
```
